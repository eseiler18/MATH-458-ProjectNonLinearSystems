### Project 3: Non-linear systems

Implementation of numerical methods for the solution of nonlinear equations.  
For a function f , find x such that : _f (x) = 0_

Mandatory: consider a scalar nonlinear problem and implement the
bisection, aitken, chord, newton and fixed point methods.

Optional: Extension to systems of nonlinear equations solved by the Newton and/or
modified Newton method.
