## Project 3: Non-linear systems

Implementation of numerical methods for the solution of nonlinear equations.  
For a function f , find x such that : _f (x) = 0_

Mandatory: consider a scalar nonlinear problem and implement the
bisection, aitken, chord, newton and fixed point methods.

Optional: Extension to systems of nonlinear equations solved by the Newton and/or
modified Newton method.

# How to use ... (LOUIS)
  Go to the root of the Project in your terminal .
	In order to compile it you should first install *googletest* and *eigen*.
  You can run this line of code to place them in their respectif place.
	
	```
	git submodule update --init 
	```
  Then, building is done as usual, in the terminal:
	
	```
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make
	```
 The Build is complee ! You can in a first time Run the Test to tcheck if everything is ok !
 	```
	cd google_test
	./Google_Tests_run
	```
 Normally, you should pass the 17 Test. They tcheck all the functionnality of your project. We will detay more about them below.
 We can know test the default main, to compute some function. We just need to go to the project repository :
  	```
	cd ..
	cd projet
	```
To better understand this project, take a look on "data.csv" file. If you have "gopen" on linux you can use :
  	```
	gopen data.csv
	```
If you are a looser on windows like Emilien, you can go to your file and open data.csv in "<rootProjetct>/build/project" folder. You will see the different exemple of function our project can handle, and the parameters you can input. Now lauch the main with no argument : it will take the "data.csv" file in input by default
	```
	./main_louis
	```
